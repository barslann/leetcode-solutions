    * Algorithm
    *Suppose we have a function boolean allUnique(String substring) which will return true if the characters in the substring are all unique, otherwise false.
    * We can iterate through all the possible substrings of the given string s and call the function allUnique.
    * If it turns out to be true, then we update our answer of the maximum length of substring without duplicate characters.
    *Time complexity : O(n3)
    * Space complexity: O(min(m,n))

    // Solution2 Approach 2: Sliding Window
    /*
    * The naive approach is very straightforward. But it is too slow. So how can we optimize it?
    * In the naive approaches, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate character. But it is unnecessary. If a substring sij
    *from index i to jâˆ’1 is already checked to have no duplicate characters. We only need to check if
    *s[j] is already in the substring sij.
    *
    * To check if a character is already in the substring, we can scan the substring
    * which leads to an O(n2) algorithm. But we can do better.
    *
    * By using HashSet as a sliding window, checking if a character in the current can be done in O(1)
    *
    *
    *
    * A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems.
    * A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e.  [ i , j ) [i,j) (left-closed, right-open).
    * A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundaries to the certain direction. For example, if we slide  [ i , j ) [i,j) to the right by  1 1 element,
    * then it becomes  [ i + 1 , j + 1 ) [i+1,j+1) (left-closed, right-open).
    *
    * Back to our problem. We use HashSet to store the characters in current window  [ i , j ) [i,j) ( j = i j=i initially).
    * Then we slide the index  j j to the right. If it is not in the HashSet, we slide  j j further.
    * Doing so until s[j] is already in the HashSet.
    * At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters start with index  i i.
    * If we do this for all  i i, we get our answer.
